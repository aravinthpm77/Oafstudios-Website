                            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
                             Many students define paragraphs in terms of 
                             length: a paragraph is a group of at least five 
                             sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. 
                             In reality, though, the unity and coherence of 
                             ideas among sentences is what constitutes a 
                             paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of
                              sentences or a single sentence that forms a 
                              unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and 
                              appearance do not determine whether a section
                               in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in 
                               some styles of writing, particularly 
                               journalistic styles, a paragraph can be 
                               just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph
                                is a sentence or group of sentences that 
                                support one main idea.
